        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the Cucumbers<br>

                    Start by washing the cucumbers thoroughly<br>  and removing any dirt or wax.<br> You can peel the cucumbers if desired or <br>leave the skin on for added texture and color.
                    Slice the cucumbers thinly, either with a knife<br> or a mandoline, and place them in <br>a mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Season with Salt <br>

                    Sprinkle salt over the sliced cucumbers <br>and gently toss to distribute the<br>salt evenly. Let them sit for about <br>15 minutes to draw out excess moisture.
                    </li>
                <li>Add Vinegar and Sugar<br>

                    Drain any accumulated liquid from the cucumbers.<br> Add vinegar (e.g., white vinegar, apple cider vinegar, or rice vinegar) <br>to the bowl, using enough to coat the <br>cucumbers.
                    Sprinkle sugar over the cucumbers, adjusting the <br>amount according to your desired level of <br>sweetness. Toss the cucumbers to evenly distribute <br>the vinegar and sugar.</li>
                <li> Incorporate Additional Ingredients<br>

                    If desired, add finely chopped or thinly sliced<br> onions, herbs (such as dill or parsley),<br> and spices (such as black pepper or chili flakes) <br>to the bowl. Mix everything together to<br> combine the flavors.</li>
                <li> Allow the Flavors to Blend<br>

                    Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or transfer <br>the cucumber condiment to a jar with a <br>tight-fitting lid. Refrigerate for <br>at least 1 hour or overnight to allow<br> the flavors to meld together and develop.
                    Stir or shake the condiment before <br>serving to ensure the flavors are <br>well-distributed.
                    </li>
